#Write a program that asks the user for three integer numbers. The program prints out the sum, product, and average of the numbers.
number1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

# Calculate sum, product, and average
sum = number1 + number2 + number3
product = number1 * number2 * number3
average = sum / 3

#print results
print(sum)
print(product)
print(average)
